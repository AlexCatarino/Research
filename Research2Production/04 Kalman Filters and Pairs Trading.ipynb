    "### Kalman Filters and Pairs Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few Python packages out there for Kalman filters, but we're adapting this example and the Kalman filter class code from [this article](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/kalman-filter-based-pairs-trading-strategy-in-qstrader) and demonstrating how you can implement similar ideas using QuantConnect!\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, a Kalman filter is a [state-space model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation) applicable to linear dynamic systems -- systems whose state is time-dependent and state variations are represented linearly. The model is used to estimate unknown states of a variable based on a series of past values. The procedure is two-fold: a prediction (estimate) is made by the filter of the current state of a variable and the uncertainty of the estimate itself. When new data is available, these estimates are updated. There is a lot of information available about Kalman filters, and the variety of their applications is pretty astounding, but for now, we're going to use a Kalman filter to estimate the hedge ratio between a pair of equities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the strategy is pretty straightforward: take two equities that are cointegrated and create a long-short portfolio. The premise of this is that the spread between the value of our two positions should be mean-reverting. Anytime the spread deviates from its expected value, one of the assets moved in an unexpected direction and is due to revert back. When the spread diverges, you can take advantage of this by going long or short on the spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, imagine you have a long position in AAPL worth \\\\$2000 and a short position in IBM worth \\\\$2000. This gives you a net spread of \\\\$0. Since you expected AAPL and IBM to move together, then if the spread increases significantly above \\\\$0, you would short the spread in the expectation that it will return to \\\\$0, it's natural equilibrium. Similarly, if the value drops significantly below \\\\$0, you would long the spread and capture the profits as its value returns to \\\\$0. In our application, the Kalman filter will be used to track the hedging ratio between our equities to ensure that the portfolio value is stationary, which means it will continue to exhibit mean-reversion behavior."
